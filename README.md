# Mecanum_Rover
Sketch used by my Mecanum wheel Rover

i am still working on this sketch, but for now this is a working example.
i use the arduino ide 1.8.19 
the microcontroller is an ESP32.
there are many tutorials on adding ESP32 boards to the arduino ide 
i am using esp32 by Espressif Systems version 2.0.8
again this is a work in progress. Future plans will remove the PS4 controller due to its limited range. Fun not very practical
This bot also has an ESP32-Cam that is only used for video streaming. i use the provided CameraWebServer sketch
